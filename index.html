One of England's best defenders is undoubtedly Kyle Walker, who has been a key figure in Manchester City's Premier League triumph in the 2017-18 season. Walker has been dating glamor model Annie Kilner since 2011. However, the right-back apparently drives his girlfriend mad with his obsessive cleaning habits.<\/p> <figure id=\"attachment_34296\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-34296\" style=\"width: 950px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=lazy class=\"wp-image-34296\" src=\"https:\/\/d3m2ca683sarz5.cloudfront.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/21094013\/wags-193.jpg\" alt=\"wags 194\" width=\"950\" height=\"633\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-34296\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Kyle Walker &amp; Annie Kilner<\/figcaption><\/figure> ","qw781jubc4nkbbzrk4xn5wb4vn2saphq":"<p>    <!--[id:qw781jubc4nkbbzrk4xn5wb4vn2saphq]--><\/p> <div class=\"page-title\"> <h2>David de Gea &amp; Edurne<\/h2> <\/div> <p>Widely regarded as the most talented goalkeeper in football today, David de Gea is another example of a footballer who is romantically involved with one of the more famous WAGs out there.

His marriage to Rebecca Ellison was tragically cut short after she lost a battle with breast cancer in 2015. However, Rio has since tried to move on, and is now in a relationship with former <em>TOWIE</em> star Katie Wright. The couple made their first public appearance at the launch of Ferdinand's new fashion line for Sports Direct. "We are so happy together. It's going really well," Wright said.</p> <div class="divider"><span>ADVERTISEMENT</span></div><div class="top_desktop_placeholder"></div><figure id="attachment_31310" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-31310" style="width: 942px" class="wp-caption aligncenter pos-relative"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-31310 " src="./Meet the Ice Queens Behind the NHL&#39;s Biggest Stars_files/wags-154-e1522227125743.jpg" alt="wags 154" width="942" height="738"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-31310" class="wp-caption-text">Rio Ferdinand &amp; Katie Wright</figcaption><div class="right_desktop_placeholder"></div></figure> <div class="divider"><span>ADVERTISEMENT</span></div><div class="bottom_desktop_placeholder"></div><div class="page-finished"></div>
